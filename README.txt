What was accomplished- everything in Milestone 1 and 2: 
  - basic landing page
  - button to enter an html page that renders a three.js file
  - interact with "player" sphere: 
	- Left arrow to move left
	- Right arrow to move right
	- spacebar to jump
  - randomly generating primitive tree terrain

Things to improve (probably will go back and work on this at Milestone 3): 
  - Will make an icon for the tab on the page
  - Will make landing page look better when resizing 
  - Better model for player and trees
  - Score keeping?
  - Build out environment more
